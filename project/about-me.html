                            <p>I love painting myself! I am not really good at it,
                            but I have found it to be relaxing and fun to do both alone and with other people. 
                            It can really create nice moments, and it is fun to see other people’s creative thinking 
                            and way of portraying their ideas. I wanted to create a website to demonstrate some of 
                            my friend’s art to show off what they have worked on!</p>

                            <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                            <p>My name is Daniel Lugo and I am 22 years old. I am a senior in the college of Arts and Sciences 
                                studying Biotechnology at Syracuse University. I love playing tennis, cooking, watching movies, 
                                hanging out with friends and family, and learning new things! My favorite foods are Italian and Asian food. 
                                I am from the Bronx in New York City where I went to High School and played in the tennis team.</p>

                            <h1>My Aspirations</h1>
                            <p>I look forward to graduation and move onto the next chapter in my life! I hope to achieve a master’s in computer science 
                                and become a software engineer in the future. I am very interested in machine learning/Artificial intelligence, 
                                back-end engineering, embedded software engineering, and medical software engineering. 
                                I hope to learn more about cooking and travel the world!</p>
